MonoDetour is a .NET detouring library powered by MonoMod.RuntimeDetour.

It focuses on being as convenient as possible while also being easy to use. And as such, hook generation with C# source generators is a core part of it, which makes hooking easy and fun.

MonoDetour comes in 3 parts:

- **MonoDetour**: The library which handles hooking
- **MonoDetour.HookGen**: The C# HookGen source generator
- **MonoDetour.ILWeaver**: A redesigned MonoMod ILCursor

MonoDetour.ILWeaver is not required to be used, although is recommended.

## Adding to Your Project

Right now, you can't add MonoDetour to your project. It will be possible once MonoDetour releases, as right now it's not stable.
