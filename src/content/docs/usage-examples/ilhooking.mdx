<Aside>
These examples are for teaching **MonoDetour.ILWeaver** for manipulating an `ILContext`.  
You can also use other APIs for manipulating an `ILContext` such as MonoMod's `ILCursor`,
even though we recommend using ILWeaver as it is based off of ILCursor.
</Aside>

To start ILHooking, we need a target method we want to hook. So, given the target type and method we want to hook:

```cs
namespace Lib;

public class LibraryClass
{
    public bool IsTrue { get; set; }

    // We want to hook this.
    public int TakeAndReturnInt(int number)
    {
        return number;
    }

    public void PrintFoo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Foo");
    }
}
```

Let's generate hooks for the type:

```cs
// Tell MonoDetour's HookGen to generate hooks
// for the target type.
[MonoDetourTargets<LibraryClass>]
// Or use [MonoDetourTargets(typeof(LibraryClass))]
// if the target type is static.
public class LibraryMethodsHooks
{
    // ...
}
```
